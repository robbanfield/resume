# GitHub Resume.

## Credits: 
Forked from the work https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/fork
who uses the theme designed by Xiaoying Riley at [3rd Wave Media](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/).
> Visit her [website](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/) for more themes.


## Installation

* [Fork](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/fork) the repository
* Set up branches to your preference. I use main as the published version.
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as 'main'.
* Your new site should be ready at `https://username.github.io/<repo_name>/`
* Change all the details from one place: ``_data/data.yml``



## To preview/edit localy with docker

```sh
docker-compose up
```

*docker-compose.yml* file is used to create a container that is reachable under http://localhost:4000.
Changes *_data/data.yml* will be visible after a while.
